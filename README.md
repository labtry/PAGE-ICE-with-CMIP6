## Abstract
Quantification of economic impacts of climate change informs policy decisions and risk management. However, integrated assessment models (IAMs) have inherent limitations in simulating geoengineered climates. This study improves climate impact assessment by assimilating projections from 48 climate models into the PAGE-ICE IAM. We assess climate change impacts driven by twelve scenarios and find that these impacts are primarily borne by warmer developing countries, with the regional rivalry scenario (SSP3-7.0) being by far the worst. The sustainable development pathway (SSP1), including considerable implicit carbon dioxide removal (CDR), cost-effectively mitigates climate change impacts, but so can scenarios using combinations of politically pledged emissions reductions with “moderate” solar geoengineering (SAI-1.5). We also compare the no mitigation policy (SSP5-8.5) plus solar geoengineering to partially offset warming, with delayed but stringent CDR measures (SSP5-3.4-OS), finding that they reduce end-of-century projections of climate damages to respectively half and a quarter of the baseline SSP5-8.5 scenario.
